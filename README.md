# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
This is my first try at a Machine Learning Project. I have used the Titanic data set available in Kaggle to predict the survival chances of passengers in the Titanic.
Since this is my first real life project, I have managed to get an accuracy of almost 80 percent. Once I gain some experience in this field, I will try to work on the accuracy even more.
